# Rationale about which attributes ad methods are made private, protected, or public is provided in code comments
# or verbally in presentation

# At least one class demonstrates composition (being composed of other objects)

# A diagram is provided that shows an overview of all the classes that make up the system design
# Diagram shows relationships between classes

# At least one class inherits from another class
# The Subclass overrides at least one superclass method
